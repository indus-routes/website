                    <p>Vrindavan, often written Vrindaban and Brindaban, is a mediaeval city in Uttar Pradesh, India's Mathura region. Situated in the Braj Bhoomi region, this city holds sacred significance for Hindus, who believe Krishna spent almost all of his formative years there. There are over 5,500 temples in Vrindavan devoted to the worship of Krishna and his principal companion, Radha. The city of Vrindavan, which is approximately 15 km north of Mathura on the Yamuna River's west bank, derives its ancient Sanskrit name from the trees of vṛinda (holy basil) and vana (a forest, woodland).</p>

                    <p>The Banke Bihari temple of Vrindavan is famous all over the world. The temple is dedicated to the youthful memories of Lord Shri Krishna and is the place where Lord Sri Krishna, the eighth avatar or incarnation of Lord Vishnu, spent his childhood days and his lovable teenage time. The city of Vrindavan is filled with temples and gardens dedicated to the life of Lord Sri Krishna. There are mainly seven such temples that are devoted to different phases of Lord Sri Krishna's youth. The Banke Bihari Temple is among that lot and depicts of Lord Sri Krishna playing his flute in the Vrindavan with a garland on his neck all while standing in a tribhanga pose and enjoying the playful banters with friends and gopis.</p>
                    <p>The literal meaning of the word banke means bent and bihari means one who enjoys anything supremely. Thus, the literal meaning of Banke Bihari Temple translates to the abode of the supreme enjoyer that is Lord Shri Krishna.</p>
                    <p>Just by having the darshan of Shri Banke Bihari, a person forgets all his sorrows and pains and just keeps staring at him. The main idol was granted to Swami Haridas by the divine pair Radha-Krishna, who appeared in person in Nidhivan (within Vrindavan) in 15th century AD.</p>

                    <p>Neem Karoli Baba known to his followers as Maharaj- Ji, is a great saint of India, a Hindu guru and a devotee of Hanuman Ji.</p>
                    <p>Baba Neem Karoli was a lifelong adept of Bhakti Yoga and encouraged Seva (service to others) as the highest form of unconditional devotion to God. Baba would say that attachment and ego are the greatest hindrances to the realization of God and that: "a learned man and a fool are alike as long as there is attachment and ego in the physical body."</p>
                    <p>He would advise people to surrender to God's will above everything else so that they might develop love and faith in him and thereby be free of unnecessary worries in life.</p>
                    <p>Baba Hari Dass was also a disciple who maintained one of the ashrams before heading to the USA to become a spiritual teacher. It is with his blessings that one of his disciples was able to become the President of India. He is the same Baba, who Steve Jobs (Apple) in his young age had gone looking for, to meet and seek blessings (the incident is mentioned in Steve Jobs biography).</p>
                    <p>The Mahasamadhi (total self-connectedness) Mandir of Neem Karoli Baba / Neeb Karori Baba is located within this ashram in Vrindavan. Hanumanji Temple, Durga Devi Temple, Sita Ram Temple, Shivaji Yugshala Temple, and Maharajji's Mahasamadhi Temple are all located within this ashram.</p>
                    <p><strong>Baba Neem Karoli used to say - "Love all, serve all, feed all"</strong></p>

                    <p>The most unusual Saint of the highest kind, whose memories never fade, was the esteemed Sri Sripad Baba of Vrindavan. During the twenty to twenty-two years that he lived was in the Divine Playfield of Lord Krishna. Babaji lived for a long time in remote parts of the Himalayas in extreme spiritual austerity. From Kanyakumari to the Northern Himalayan Mountain range, people from all walks of life have told numerous stories of Baba's life. Early on in his stay at Vrindavan, he frequently travelled to the Himalayas with followers.</p>
                    <p>Although Babaji was physically tiny and slender, he used to appear to have a massive body that led in front of others who followed him. While the trip was filled with difficulties, the devotees never experienced any weariness or difficulty along the way, thanks to the grace of God.</p>
                    <p>In reality, the Spiritual Master or Guru is the Supreme Lord manifest in human form, having transcended the realm of material consciousness.</p>

                    <p>Devraha Baba, often revered as the "ageless saint of the Yamuna," was a mystic whose presence drew seekers, sages, and statesmen alike. Known for his radiant serenity and deep yogic powers, he lived on a wooden platform above the river, offering blessings to devotees who believed he could see into past lives and guide souls toward higher awareness. He took samadhi in Maha Samadhi in 1990.</p>
                    <p>Baba was widely regarded as a saint of extraordinary abilities, believed to possess miraculous powers that brought healing and solace to countless devotees. Stories surrounding Devraha Baba speak of remarkable feats—appearing in more than one place at a time, remaining underwater for long durations, healing with a single glance, and offering insights into the future. He was also said to communicate effortlessly with animals and calm even the wildest creatures.</p>
                    <p>Many followers credited the transformative turns in their spiritual or personal lives to the grace that flowed from his presence. His ashram in Vrindavan remains a quiet sanctuary where the air feels steeped in devotion. Visitors still speak of the palpable peace that surrounds the space—an atmosphere shaped by decades of his meditation, silence, and divine discipline. Even today, the ashram stands as a reminder of his message: that humility, purity, and unwavering faith can transform a human life into a vessel of grace.</p>
                    <p>A visit to his ashram offers not just a glimpse into the legacy of a great saint, but an encounter with an enduring spiritual presence that continues to inspire all who come seeking inner light.</p>
