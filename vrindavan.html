                    <p>Vrindavan, often written Vrindaban and Brindaban, is a mediaeval city in Uttar Pradesh, India's Mathura region. Situated in the Braj Bhoomi region, this city holds sacred significance for Hindus, who believe Krishna spent almost all of his formative years there. There are over 5,500 temples in Vrindavan devoted to the worship of Krishna and his principal companion, Radha. The city of Vrindavan, which is approximately 15 km north of Mathura on the Yamuna River's west bank, derives its ancient Sanskrit name from the trees of vṛinda (holy basil) and vana (a forest, woodland). The Banke Bihari temple of Vrindavan is famous all over the world. The temple is dedicated to the youthful memories of Lord Shri Krishna and is the place where Lord Sri Krishna, the eighth avatar or incarnation of Lord Vishnu, spent his childhood days and his lovable teenage time. The city of Vrindavan is filled with temples and gardens dedicated to the life of Lord Sri Krishna. There are mainly seven such temples that are devoted to different phases of Lord Sri Krishna's youth. The Banke Bihari Temple is among that lot and depicts of Lord Sri Krishna playing his flute in the Vrindavan with a garland on his neck all while standing in a tribhanga pose and enjoying the playful banters with friends and gopis. The literal meaning of the word banke means bent and bihari means one who enjoys anything supremely. Thus, the literal meaning of Banke Bihari Temple translates to the abode of the supreme enjoyer that is Lord Shri Krishna.</p>

                      <p>Neem Karoli Baba known to his followers as Maharaj- Ji, is a great saint of India, a Hindu guru and a devotee of Hanuman Ji.</p>
                      <p>Baba Neem Karoli was a lifelong adept of Bhakti Yoga and encouraged Seva (service to others) as the highest form of unconditional devotion to God. Baba would say that attachment and ego are the greatest hindrances to the realization of God and that: "a learned man and a fool are alike as long as there is attachment and ego in the physical body."</p>
                      <p>He would advise people to surrender to God's will above everything else so that they might develop love and faith in him and thereby be free of unnecessary worries in life.</p>
                      <p>Baba Hari Dass was also a disciple who maintained one of the ashrams before heading to the USA to become a spiritual teacher. It is with his blessings that one of his disciples was able to become the President of India. He is the same Baba, who Steve Jobs (Apple) in his young age had gone looking for, to meet and seek blessings (the incident is mentioned in Steve Jobs biography).</p>
                      <p>Neem Karoli Baba's ashrams are in Kainchi, Vrindavan, Rishikesh, Shimla, Bhumiadhar, Hanuman Gadi, Lucknow and Delhi in India, and internationally in Taos, New Mexico, USA. During his life two main ashrams were built, first at Vrindavan and later at Kainchi, Uttarakhand where he spent the summer months.</p>
                      <p>The Mahasamadhi (total self-connectedness) Mandir of Neem Karoli Baba / Neeb Karori Baba is located within this ashram in Vrindavan. Hanumanji Temple, Durga Devi Temple, Sita Ram Temple, Shivaji Yugshala Temple, and Maharajji's Mahasamadhi Temple are all located within this ashram.</p>
                      <p>Babaji Maharaj has already set a date for His departure from this world. He had to decide where to have His body cremated and set up a location so that His followers may construct a temple in remembrance.</p>
                      <p>Motivated by the spiritual force of Babaji, his followers combined His physical body with the ashram's elements and constructed a platform out of sandalwood and cremated Baba's body.</p>
