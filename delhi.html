                    <p>Though Sai Baba might have left his mortal coil, he still is alive for his devotees. He is a Living God. Even today, though he has left his gross body, we feel his presence and obtain his grace and protection every day.</p>
                    <p><em>"I have come into this world to divert your thoughts from materialism toward spiritualism, and establish truth, righteousness, peace and love in you, and through you to the entire mankind and bless them with peace and happiness."</em></p>
                    <p>These words of Shirdi Sai Baba, a great Sufi of India, reflect the way he lived his life, and continues to influence the lives of his many devotees all over the world. There are countless stories of blessings and miracles granted by his grace.</p>
                    <p>Every five hundred years, God comes on earth in human form, like Jesus, Krishna, Mahavira, Mohammad, Buddha, Guru Nanak, Shankaracharya, Neem Karoli Baba and Shirdi Sai Baba. They are real messengers of God, who come to give a new direction to our lives, to remind us of the power of Divine Love.</p>
                    <p>One of his well-known sayings is: <strong>"Sabka Malik Ek."</strong> (One God governs all). He dressed like a Muslim fakir and for sixty years he lived in a rundown mosque in Shirdi that he called Dwarakamai. Within the mosque he kept a sacred fire lighting in the Hindu tradition and used the Udi (ash) to heal people.</p>
                    <p>On this trip, you will visit the temple of Sai Baba located in Central Delhi. Although, there are many Shirdi Sai Baba's temples in the city, the one we will visit is the oldest, most famous and the most revered. The Temple is a beautiful sacred place decorated with gorgeous idols of deities, which leave you spellbound.</p>

                    <p>Dargah Patte Wali Hazrat Shamsuddin Utawala Rahmattullah is inscribed on the marble plaque over the door. Below it 'Baab e Rahmat' is written in bold letters, which means 'door of mercy'.</p>
                    <p>Hazrat Shamsuddin was given the name 'Utawala' because the desires of people who visited him used to be fulfilled very quickly. The steps to the green door are usually lined by alms – seekers in a state of stupor. They do not seek alms in the name of Allah or Muhammah, alternatively, in the name of 'Barkatkaari'.</p>
                    <p>He who showers 'Barkat'; well- being, prosperity and blessings. At first sight you see a bare courtyard and another green door in the corner to the left. Through the gate is the ceremonious Mazaar of Patte Shah's Dargah draped in green satin.</p>
                    <p>Patte Shah was a contemporary to Hazrat Nizamuddin. He is much lesser known but possessed equally extraordinary spiritual powers. The site of the Dargah was his worship place.</p>

                    <p>On weekends, there are children lining up in the small yard outside for a free Langar (meals from the kitchen). Inside the not very large church, things are even more informal and chilled out, without ceasing to be religious in the least.</p>
                    <p>Out in the front, near the altar, a man in a plain blue shirt ties black thread to supplicants. A woman in a sari moves around the altar railing, blessing those who kneel to pray with the crown of Our Lady. There are no vestments or white robes in sight. It all seems very informal, including the kids running around.</p>
                    <p>Not all those who come are Tamil, or even Christians. In fact, both seem in a minority at this church, which by the looks of it attracts a far more diverse, largely working class following.</p>
                    <p>The church is named for the Basilica of Our Lady of Health in Vailankanni, Tamil Nadu a state in southern India, it is renowned for its miracles. Built here in 1959, it's unlike any Catholic church you have ever seen.</p>
                    <p>The Church of Our Lady of Vailankanni, has signs in English, Hindi and Tamil language: Mata Mariyam ke bhakt, as the Hindi goes.</p>
                    <p>There is a huge Rath or chariot parked in one corner of the yard, and on the feast day in September, a procession- thousands strong—goes down on the streets of south Delhi.</p>
